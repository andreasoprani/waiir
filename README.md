# Writing an Interpreter in Rust

This is my implementation of the Monkey Language Interpreter from the book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.

I wrote it to exercise and practice Rust while following the book, so it may have some problems.

I glanced at @AlphaKeks's [implementation](https://github.com/AlphaKeks/interpreter/tree/master) when I got stuck so you may find some similarities.
